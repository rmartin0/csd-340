		<h1>Assignment 2.3 &#45; Building a Web Page Exercise, Part 2</h1>
		<h2>Chapter 1: HTML</h2>
		<p class="intro">My name is Bojack. Bojack Horseman. You might know me from the hit 90s sitcom, Horsin' around. Loved by many, changed peoples' lives, yadda yadda, you get the gist. Anyway, I'm not here to talk about that, I'm here to tell you about my life.</p>
		<p>I was born January 2nd, 1964, in San Fransisco. My mother's name was Beatrice, and my father was Butterscotch. They're both dead now. I don't like to think about my childhood, so I'll spare you the boring details.</p>
		<p>I guess my upbringing played a pretty big role in who I am today. You know, sometimes I think I was born with a leak, and any goodness I started with just slowly spilled out of me and now it's all gone. And I'll never get it back in me. It's too late. <span class="sentence">Life is a set of closing doors, isn't it?</span> </p>
		<p>What was I talking about? Oh yeah, I'm supposed to tell you fun facts about myself. I like to...uh... My hobbies are...hmm... My friends are...yikes. You know what? Screw this. I'm just going to hire a ghost writer.</p>
